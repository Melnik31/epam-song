As you promised me that I was more than all the miles combined
You must have had yourself a change of heart
Like halfway through the drive
'Cause your voice trailed off exactly as you passed my exit sign
Kept on driving straight and left our future to the right
Now I am stuck between my anger
And the blame that I can't face
And memories are something
Even smoking weed does not replace
And I am terrified of weather 'cause I see you when it rains
Doc told me to travel, but there's COVID on the planes
And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks and I
Saw your mom she forgot that I existed and
It's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do, ooh, ooh
